    <h1>Welcome to My Home Page</h1>
    <p>
      This website contains three pages: my home page, my professional resume,
      and a page about my future career. On this home page, I share two of my
      favorite activities: weightlifting and football.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Enjoy Weightlifting</h2>
    <p>
      Weightlifting is a hobby that helps me stay healthy and build discipline.
      It requires consistency, focus, and hard work. The progress made in the
      gym motivates me to push myself in other areas of life.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Enjoy Football</h2>
    <p>
      Football is one of my favorite sports because it emphasizes teamwork,
      strategy, and determination. I enjoy both playing in high school with friends
      and watching professional games.
